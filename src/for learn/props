u can send data form component to other by props 
u define attribute in the react component tag and pass props as param to the target component
u can pass default value to ur component vars to avoid if there mistake when its get the value by props

we use the attribute name in the other component not the value !!
const x = 1
<header res = {x} />
we use in this case res not x 

function name . default props  to set the default if any mistake accured

u can also clean the code by pass the object of attributes that send by props
to the child function
